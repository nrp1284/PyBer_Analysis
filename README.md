## Project: Ride Sharing Data by City

Project Sponser: PyBer

Projecct manager: Nayan patel

Project Scope: - Finding Weekly Fares by eacch city and hehp create report thatstakeholders making deesion on this  findings. 

## Deliverables:

Deliverable 1: A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type

Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type

Deliverable 3: A written report for the PyBer analysis 

## Overview of the analysis: 

The provides Summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type helped creating a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type to make a final report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results:

1. Summary of Differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

a) Total Fare and Average fare by City types:

 1. Rural: Total fare  is $4327.93 and Average fare is $34.62
 
 2. Suburban: Total fare  is $19356.33 and Average fare is $30.97
 
 3. Urban: Total fare  is $39854.38 and Average fare is $24.53
 
We can clearly see that there are some points needed to be considered in deciding marketing efforts for rural cities that helps over all ride counts and ROI

## Following figures describes all analyis that can help making best decesions fo PyBer.
